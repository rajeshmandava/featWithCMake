This is notetaking on CMake.

Why CMake has upper hand compared to other build tools:<br />
    1)It stays focused on supporting modern compilers and toolchains.<br />
    2)CMake is truly cross platform -  supporting Linux, macOS, Windows and Cygwin.<br />
    3)It generates project files for popular IDEs: Microsoft visual studio, Xcode and Eclipse CDT. Additionally, it is a project model for others such as CLion.<br />
    4)CMake operates on just the right level of abstraction - it allows you to group files in reusable targets and projects.<br />
    5)There are tons of projects that are built with CMake and offer and easy way to include them in your project.<br />
    6)CMake views testing, packaging, and installing as an inherent part of the build process.<br />
    7)Old, unused features get deprecated to keep CMake lean.<br />
